---

## Domain Analysis & Bounded Contexts

### 1. Company Management Context (Multi-tenancy)
**Purpose**: Manage SaaS tenants and user access
**Core Entities**:
- `Company` - Tenant root aggregate
- `User/Employee` - Company members with roles
- `CompanySettings` - Tenant-specific configuration
- `ShiftConfiguration` - Company-defined time slots
- `PermissionRule` - Granular delegation permissions

**Key Business Rules**:
- Complete data isolation between companies
- User belongs to exactly one company
- Company admin can manage users and spaces

**Responsibilities**:
- User authentication and authorization
- Company registration and management
- Role-based access control
- Data tenant isolation

### 2. Space Management Context
**Purpose**: Define and manage bookable resources
**Core Entities**:
- `Space` (Abstract) - Base for all bookable resources
- `Desk` - Individual workstation with bundled resources
- `MeetingRoom` - Collaborative space with flexible duration
- `DeskResource` - Monitor, connectors (bundled with desk)
- `AdditionalResource` - Optional add-ons for desks
- `Floor/Location` - Physical organization
- `TimeConstraint` - Duration limits per space/location/company

**Key Business Rules**:
- Spaces belong to a company with custom configurations
- Desks include bundled resources (monitor, connectors)
- Meeting rooms have flexible duration with configurable limits
- Additional resources can be added to desk bookings (if permitted)
- Time constraints cascade: company → location → space

**Responsibilities**:
- Space catalog management
- Availability calculation
- Physical layout representation
- Resource allocation

### 3. Booking Context (Core Domain)
**Purpose**: Handle all booking operations and business rules
**Core Entities**:
- `Booking` - Main aggregate root
- `BookingPolicy` - Business rule enforcement
- `TimeSlot` - Temporal booking period
- `BookingDelegation` - Permission to book for others

**Key Business Rules**:
- **Desk Policy**: One desk per user per day (includes attached resources)
- **Meeting Room Policy**: Multiple bookings allowed, flexible duration with company limits
- **Delegation Policy**: Granular permission system (manager→team, admin→anyone, custom rules)
- **Shift Policy**: Company-configurable time slots (no system restrictions)
- **Resource Bundling**: Desk bookings include monitor, connectors, optional add-ons
- **Time Boundaries**: Company/location/space-specific duration limits
- **Conflict Resolution**: Prevent double bookings across all contexts

**Responsibilities**:
- Booking creation and validation
- Business rule enforcement
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Booking lifecycle management

### 4. Notification Context (Supporting)
**Purpose**: Communicate booking events to users
**Core Entities**:
- `Notification` - User communication
- `NotificationTemplate` - Message formatting
- `DeliveryChannel` - Email, in-app, etc.

**Responsibilities**:
- Booking confirmations
- Reminder notifications
- Cancellation alerts
- System announcements
